# Testing Zero-Shot Prompting with OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo

This project demonstrates the application of OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo to extract specific entities, in this case, fruit names, from text data in a CSV file. The primary steps involved are:

1. Reading data from a CSV file.
2. Using OpenAI's API to process and extract the required information from the text.
3. Storing the processed results back into a new CSV file.
